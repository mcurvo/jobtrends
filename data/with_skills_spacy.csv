Unsurprisingly, students are losing their creativity and motivation, and are utterly unprepared to succeed in the real world.In our virtual program, middle and high school students work on passion-based projects that they get to create and take wherever they wish. They donât spend their school hours attending lecture-based classes and donât read many traditional textbooks â instead, theyâre building video games, writing fantasy novels, conducting scientific research, and more! They connect with industry mentors to expose them to new careers and fields of study. Students learn not only the full breadth of academic subjects but also important soft skills and subjects such as financial literacy, philosophy, and more. Our school is organized in small, tight-knit cohorts so every group of students and faculty can feel close and engaged in their community.Weâve embarked on our journey to accelerate students toward their wildest dreams.

However, it has fallen short in generating mass consumer applications and remains largely centered around finance. We believe blockchain technology is a cornerstone for the future of new, open Internet applications.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Today, there are limits to what you can build on-chain. Many factors constrain this, from the cost of running applications to the fundamental performance limitations of existing blockchains. We believe that new technologies can unlock a new class of real-time applications that normally must be built on Web2 foundations. Enabling these systems to be built on-chain will allow the free movement of businesses and users between online platforms, creating what we call a true virtual society.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We are building Somnia, a fast and cost-effective EVM-based blockchain, to achieve this. Somnia is a layer-one blockchain with full EVM compatibility, capable of processing over 400,000 transactions per second with sub-second latency and low fees. This will unlock a new wave of on-chain applications. Initially, we are focusing on gaming, metaverse, and social experiences.

Flow is home today to millions of users and apps from top tier creators including Genies, Cryptoys, Doodles, and Dapper Labs (NBA, NFL, Disney) as well as industry leaders such as Mattel (Barbie, Hot Wheels), LiveNation / Ticketmaster, and many more.</p><p><br></p><p>2025 will be Flowâs biggest year yet. To prepare, Flow launched Flow Wallet - a new wallet built from the ground up for Flow. Flow Wallet aims to set the new standard for wallets across all of Web3 by leveraging whatâs uniquely possible with Flowâs account abstraction, smart contract programming language Cadence, and mainstream consumer audience.</p><p><br></p><p>Flowâs mission is to take Web3 mainstream, and Flow Wallet is a big piece of the puzzle for how weâll get there. We believe itâs unacceptable for users to have to tolerate the possibility of losing their keys, assets or accounts, have to set up their wallets using complex seed phrases, or worry about things like gas fees. At the end of the day, users just want to have fun, and feel safe to explore and experience what Web3 makes possible for them.</p><p><br></p><p>As Flow Walletâs Tech Lead, youâll get to pave the way forward for the Web3 industry at large, and youâll love that youâll be empowered to solve the frustrations you have with Web3 wallets first hand.</p><p><br></p><p><b style=""font-size: 18pt;"">About the Role</b></p><p><br></p><p>Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to lead Flow Walletâs engineering team.

Youâll be on the front lines of how Web3 will go mainstream, and solve major industry problems like user onboarding to crypto, empowering users to truly own their assets with self-custody, and drive mainstream adoption to Web3 apps.</p>\n<p></p><p><br></p><b>Hereâs what your scope will include: </b><ul><li><b>Building industry leading wallet features: </b>Flow Wallet is currently working towards becoming the world's first multi-VM wallet, supporting both the Cadence and EVM ecosystems on Flow.

Users need to be and feel safe in order to feel confident in exploring the universe of apps and assets on Flow. Flow Wallet pioneers Flow native features such as human readable transactions, capability based security with Cadence, and secure enclave integration to pave the way towards industry leading security for our users. Youâll be responsible for the security of users and their assets secured by Flow Wallet.</li><li><b>Product-minded software engineering: </b>Flowâs next challenges require engineers who love bridging the gap between product and engineering. The complexities in delivering an industry leading wallet require engineers on Flow Wallet to think through how their software impacts our users, and be mindful of how what we build can impact them. Youâll be responsible for translating product requirements into user value, and understanding how to best get there through the software you create.</li><li><b>Self-driven execution: </b>Flow believes experienced engineering leads must drive business initiatives from start to finish, work autonomously and use their intuition from experience to guide their success.

Flow is home today to millions of users and apps from top tier creators including Dapper Labs (NBA, NFL, Disney) as well as industry leaders such as Mattel (Barbie, Hot Wheels), LiveNation / Ticketmaster, and many more.</p><p><br></p><p>2025 will be Flowâs biggest year yet. To prepare, Flow launched Flow Wallet - a new wallet built from the ground up for Flow. Flow Wallet aims to set the new standard for wallets across all of Web3 by leveraging whatâs uniquely possible with Flowâs account abstraction, smart contract programming language Cadence, and mainstream consumer audience.</p><p><br></p><p>Flowâs mission is to take Web3 mainstream, and Flow Wallet is a big piece of the puzzle for how weâll get there. We believe itâs unacceptable for users to have to tolerate the possibility of losing their keys, assets or accounts, have to set up their wallets using complex seed phrases, or worry about things like gas fees. At the end of the day, users just want to have fun, and feel safe to explore and experience what Web3 makes possible for them.</p><p><br></p><p>As Flow Walletâs Design Lead, youâll get to pave the way forward for the Web3 industry at large, and youâll love that youâll be empowered to solve the frustrations you have with Web3 wallets first hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to lead Flow Walletâs design. Youâll get to dive into designing awesome new features like account recovery, human readable transactions, secure enclave support, passkey integration and many many more. Youâll be on the front lines of how Web3 will go mainstream, and solve major industry problems like user onboarding to crypto, empowering users to truly own their assets with self-custody, and drive mainstream adoption to Web3 apps.</p>\n<p></p><p><br></p><b>Here's what your scope will include:</b><ul><li><b>Designing industry leading wallet features: </b>Flow Wallet is currently working towards becoming the world's first multi-VM wallet, supporting both the Cadence and EVM ecosystems on Flow.

The complexities in delivering an industry leading wallet will require you to think through how your designs impact our users. Youâll be responsible for translating product requirements into user value, and understanding how to best get there through the designs you create.</li><li><b>Self-driven execution: </b>Flow believes experienced design leads must drive business initiatives from start to finish, work autonomously and use their intuition from experience to guide their success.&nbsp;â¢ </li><li><b>Delivering mainstream-ready quality: </b>Flow is gearing up to support not only itâs existing ecosystem of Cadence developers, but also the rest of the Web3 ecosystem of EVM builders.

Ro is the only company to offer nationwide telehealth, labs, and pharmacy services. This is enabled by Ro's vertically integrated platform that helps patients achieve their goals through a convenient, end-to-end healthcare experience spanning from diagnosis, to delivery of medication, to ongoing care. Since 2017, Ro has helped millions of patients in nearly every single county in the United States, including 98% of primary care deserts.</p><p><br></p><p>The healthcare system today is not designed to help patients achieve their goals. Itâs designed around institutions such as hospitals and insurance companies. A patient centric healthcare system is one that is designed around the goals a patient wants to achieve. Weâre building healthcare that puts patients in control, provides reactive and proactive care, has transparent pricing and process, is extremely effective and ridiculously convenient, and evolves over time based on patientsâ goals.</p><p><br></p><p>Ro has been recognized as a Fortune Best Workplace in New York and Health Care for four consecutive years (2021-2024). In 2023, Ro was also named Best Workplace for Parents for the third year in a row.
